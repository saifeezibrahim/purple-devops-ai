## 2.45.1 - 2026-04-20

- fix: Tighter releases. Build verification stays stable across calendar days and CI runners.

## 2.45.0 - 2026-04-19

- feat: Claude Desktop one-click install with safe defaults.
- feat: Download the `.mcpb` bundle from any release and double-click. Your agent gets `list_hosts`, `get_host` and `list_containers` out of the box. No shell, no container control.
- feat: `purple mcp --read-only` exposes the same safe trio when wiring up Claude Code, Cursor or any other MCP client by hand.
- feat: Every MCP tool call lands in `~/.purple/mcp-audit.log` as JSON. Timestamp, tool, args, outcome, reason. Owner-only file mode. `run_command` arguments redacted so passwords on shell flags never hit disk. Redirect with `--audit-log <PATH>` or turn it off with `--no-audit`.
- feat: Audit log refuses to open through a pre-existing symlink, so a writable-directory attacker cannot redirect writes elsewhere. `run_command` switched off busy-polling and clamps oversized timeouts, so a runaway agent cannot pin the server.
- feat: Linux musl builds for `x86_64` and `aarch64` ship next to the existing glibc binaries. Drop the static binary on any distro and run.
- change: Wordmark refreshed with cleaner box-drawing strokes. Same cadence, still a cyan period at the end.

## 2.44.0 - 2026-04-18

- feat: Live progress, live hosts, untruncated IPs.
- feat: The sync footer shows which provider is in flight, how many providers are done and a running diff, so you can tell at a glance what is changing in your host list.
- feat: Online indicators pulse gently so a quick scan of the host list tells you which hosts are alive right now.
- feat: IP addresses in the address column always render in full, even next to a ProxyJump or tunnel indicator, so you can read and copy them without squinting.
- change: Welcome, Help and What's New overlays share one clean logotype with the cyan-dot accent from the landing page, giving web and TUI one consistent look.
- fix: Upgrade toasts fire reliably after a brew or curl install when the previous run was a dev build, so you actually see release notes for the version you just installed.

## 2.43.2 - 2026-04-18

- feat: Cleaner internals, steadier releases.
- change: Domain types now live with the state they belong to. Screens, pickers, tags, sync records and reload tracking each move to their own module, so the next change you make lands in one obvious place.
- change: The `UiSelection` god-struct becomes a small set of focused picker states, making overlay behaviour easier to read and extend.
- change: `App::new` shrinks from 124 lines to 48 by delegating to per-substate constructors that make startup initialisation explicit.

## 2.43.1 - 2026-04-18

- feat: Tighter foundations for faster, safer releases.
- change: App state is split into six focused domains (hosts, tunnels, snippets, providers, forms, status) so changes land in one place and are easier to reason about.
- change: New behaviour tests cover status routing, toast expiry and provider ordering, catching regressions earlier.
- change: Fewer surprise file reads at startup. Provider state loads explicitly in one place, so tests and tools run predictably.

## 2.43.0 - 2026-04-18

- feat: Confident edits on every host, shared lines included.
- feat: Multi-alias `Host` lines like `Host web-01 web-01.prod` are first-class in the TUI. Edit, rename and delete them from any alias and the on-disk config keeps up.
- feat: Deleting one alias from a shared line keeps the surviving aliases and their shared directives in place, ready to use.
- feat: The delete confirm dialog spells out the sibling aliases that will survive, so you press y knowing exactly what stays.
- change: Vault SSH certificates and Vault HTTP endpoints scope themselves per-alias automatically, keeping shared lines clean.
- change: OpenSSH itself is now a test oracle. Purple's parse and serialize cycle is cross-validated against `ssh -G` on 16 curated configs plus every fuzz seed, on top of 637k-run fuzzing.

## 2.42.3 - 2026-04-18

- change: Codebase tune-up: sharper debug trail, snappier renders.
- change: Debug logs now show every screen navigation, so support bundles explain exactly how you got into a state
- change: Cloud sync thread-spawn failures log the underlying OS error instead of a generic "failed to start" toast
- change: Preference-save errors (view mode, sort order) now surface in the debug log instead of being silently dropped
- fix: Remove a theoretical crash path in toast-timeout calculation when a new message class is added

## 2.42.2 - 2026-04-18

- change: Snappier host list. Safer, tighter releases.
- change: Large inventories render faster. Column widths and group health summaries are cached across frames instead of rebuilt on every render tick
- change: Editing the installer or landing page no longer risks breaking getpurple.sh. One command regenerates the embedded copies from source
- change: Full pre-commit suite now runs in CI. Format, clippy, build, test, deny, MSRV, doc, site sync, smoke test, design system, messages, keybindings and visual regression all gate every push
- change: Adding a new cloud provider is one entry in one table instead of edits to four parallel lookups
- fix: Update, tunnel and snippet CLI output routed through the centralized message module, keeping wording consistent

## 2.42.1 - 2026-04-17

- fix: SSH prompts no longer bleed into the TUI
- fix: Opening the container overlay on an untrusted host now shows a clear "host key unknown" message instead of raw SSH prompt text leaking across the screen
- fix: Background SSH fetches (containers, file browser listings) refuse untrusted hosts cleanly. Connect once with Enter to trust a host, then the overlays work as expected
- change: Captured SSH calls no longer inherit stdin, so nothing can escape into the terminal while purple is drawing

## 2.42.0 - 2026-04-17

- feat: What's New catches up even if you skipped releases
- feat: Press n on the host list or command palette to reopen the overlay
- fix: Overlay bullets render without raw markdown and wrap cleanly on narrow terminals
- fix: Version-check cache writes atomically and survives long release headlines

## 2.41.1 - 2026-04-16

- fix: Picker hints now say Space, matching the key you actually press
- fix: Password Source, ProxyJump, SSH Key, Vault SSH Role and provider Regions/Endpoint fields all show the correct Space hint
- fix: Flaky preferences test race eliminated. Handler and preferences tests no longer collide
- change: Form hint copy centralized in one place so wording stays consistent across forms
- change: Docs caught up. llms.txt, landing page and wiki now say Space for picker opens

## 2.41.0 - 2026-04-16

- feat: One consistent look, feel and keyboard everywhere
- feat: Enter always submits. Space activates the focused field. No more guessing which key does what
- feat: Confirm dialogs accept only y, n or Esc. Labels spell out the stakes before you commit
- feat: Toast notifications show a shrinking bar. Errors stay until acknowledged. Warnings auto-expire
- feat: Focused form fields tell you what Space does. Toggles, pickers and text fields each show their own hint
- fix: A stray keypress no longer silently triggers destructive actions. Closes [#27](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/issues/27)
- fix: Closing the bulk tag editor with unsaved changes now asks before discarding them

## 2.40.0 - 2026-04-15

- feat: Provider sync catches API drift before your config breaks
- fix: Security update. rustls-webpki CVE patched
- feat: All 16 providers validated against upstream OpenAPI specs on every push. See [#28](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/issues/28)
- feat: Daily GitHub Actions watches 12 provider changelog pages for deprecation keywords
- fix: Flaky bulk_tag_undo test from a shared temp file path

## 2.39.0 - 2026-04-14

- feat: API contract tests catch provider drift before it breaks your syncs
- feat: 32 golden fixtures cover all 16 providers and every documented endpoint
- feat: 35 integration tests run on every push to detect response structure changes early

## 2.38.1

- Fix i3D.net FlexMetal OS metadata not showing
- The FlexMetal API returns `os.slug` (e.g. `ubuntu-2204-lts`), not `os.name`. Purple now reads `slug` first with `name` as fallback, so OS info appears in host details and metadata

## 2.38.0

- Bulk tag editor for multi-host tagging
- Select hosts with Space (or Ctrl+Space), press t to open the bulk tag overlay. Tri-state checkboxes: [x] add to all, [ ] remove from all, [~] leave as-is. Space cycles through all three states
- Press + to add a brand-new tag. Enter applies, Esc cancels. u undoes the entire operation in one keystroke
- Plain Space now toggles host selection (Ctrl+Space still works). Esc clears the selection
- Footer shows bulk actions (t bulk tag, r run, Esc clear, ? help) when hosts are selected
- Include-file hosts are detected and skipped with a visible warning. Mixed-state rows show a "mixed" label for accessibility on NO_COLOR terminals
- Closes [#15](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/issues/15)

## 2.37.0

- Smarter forms, jump host suggestions and polished overlays
- Typing a domain or IP in the Name field auto-suggests it as the Host value. Works on Tab, Down and Enter, skips when Host is already populated
- Tags in host and pattern detail panels separated by commas (`prod, web, europe`) instead of spaces, so tags containing spaces aren't ambiguous
- Confirmation toasts now stay visible for 4 seconds instead of 3
- ProxyJump picker promotes likely jump hosts into a Suggestions section, ranked by usage count, keyword match (`jump`/`bastion`/`gateway`/`proxy`/`gw`) and shared domain suffix ([#14](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/issues/14))
- Help overlay redesigned: essentials only on the host list, centered layout, clearer labels, wiki link points to the full command reference

## 2.36.1

- Host indicators stay visible when the detail panel is open
- Tunnel (⇄) and proxy jump (↗) indicators now appear next to the host name in compact view instead of disappearing with the address column. Active tunnels show in purple, configured tunnels and jumps in muted style
- Vault SSH sign dialog spacing improved. Host list is visually separated from the question and the skip note

## 2.36.0

- Vault SSH role picker and smarter defaults
- Vault SSH Role field offers a picker when roles are already configured on other hosts or providers. Press Enter to pick or type one manually ([#26](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/issues/26))
- Scheme-aware default ports for Vault address: `:443` for https, `:80` for http, `:8200` for bare hostnames
- Vault SSH placeholder hints explain authentication flow ("auth via vault login")
- SSH disconnect reasons shown in toast instead of just "exited with code 255". Full stderr context joined with pipe separators so you see why the connection was closed
- Vault batch signing completion status now properly clears the sticky progress footer
- Tags and alias placeholder hints clarified to avoid comma confusion
- Tag input bar shows placeholder with cursor before hint text when empty
- Updated dependencies to latest compatible versions

## 2.35.1

- Internal cleanup. Leaner App struct and event loop
- App state grouped into sub-structs: PingState, VaultState, UpdateState, TagState ([#25](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/issues/25))
- Event loop arms extracted from run_tui (1300 lines) into handler/event_loop.rs
- CLI subcommand handlers extracted from main() into cli.rs
- SshContext struct eliminates repeated function arguments across remote operations
- SnippetEvent bridge thread removed. Snippets send events directly to the main loop
- TUI smoke test: automated tmux-based test navigates all 22 screens in demo mode
- Fixed 6 flaky test races (hardcoded temp paths and global state interference)
- Fixed 9 rustdoc warnings (unclosed HTML tags and bare URLs in doc comments)

## 2.35.0

- Command palette. Press `:` to search and run any action
- 24 searchable actions: add, edit, delete, file explorer, tunnels, containers, SSH keys, providers and more ([#21](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/issues/21))
- Type to filter by name, press Enter to execute. Case-insensitive matching
- Up/Down to navigate, Esc to close, Backspace to clear filter
- Shortcuts shown next to each command so you learn the direct keys over time
- Footer shows `: cmds` hint. Help overlay lists `:` in the TOOLS section

## 2.34.0

- Toast notifications for user action feedback
- Copy, sort, delete and error messages now appear as a bordered overlay box in the bottom-right corner instead of blending into the footer
- Toast queue buffers rapid actions so no feedback is lost (max 5 queued)
- Keyboard hints in the footer stay visible at all times. Status messages no longer replace the "? more" help hint
- Four message classes: Confirmation (toast, 1.5s), Info (footer, 3s), Alert (toast, 5s) and Progress (footer, sticky)
- Background events like provider sync and ping go to the footer. Direct user actions go to toast
- Debug logging for all status message routing decisions

## 2.33.5

- Debug logging for silent error paths across the codebase
- Pipe read failures in MCP tool execution, Vault SSH signing and Tailscale provider now surface in the log instead of being silently swallowed
- First-launch init (directory creation, SSH config backup, permission setting) logs warnings on failure
- Connection history read/write errors, preferences file access failures and SSH config backup pruning failures are now logged
- Thread panics in stderr capture (SSH connection) and stdout/stderr readers (snippet execution) log a warning instead of silently returning empty strings
- Tunnel and process cleanup failures (kill/wait) log at debug level
- Proxmox guest OS info and VM config API calls log the specific failure reason instead of returning None silently
- Version check cache write failures log at debug level

## 2.33.4

- Internal: extract CLI handlers from main.rs, move test modules into dedicated files across the codebase, document unsafe block invariants, replace fragile unwrap patterns with let-else guards, route TUI-context error messages through the log system instead of stderr

## 2.33.3

- Safer render paths: recover from poisoned mutex, remove unwrap panics from container overlay, replace unreachable! with safe fallbacks in provider and tunnel forms
- Faster host sorting: cache lowercased keys instead of allocating per comparison. HashSet dedup for group tab ordering
- Allocation-free host width calculation in the host list renderer
- Container cache write errors now surface in the debug log instead of being silently swallowed
- Internal: split handler.rs (11k lines) and app.rs (11k lines) into focused submodules. No behavior change

## 2.33.2

- Active tunnels now render green in the detail panel
- Tunnel rules in the detail panel TUNNELS section use a `→` arrow between the local and remote endpoints, so `LocalForward 8200 10.30.0.3:8200` displays as `L 8200 → 10.30.0.3:8200`. DynamicForward entries keep their single-value form (`D 1080`)
- Active tunnel lines use the theme success color instead of bold, matching the green convention already used for active hosts in the host list

## 2.33.1

- Askpass now works from headless ssh sessions on Linux
- Switch `SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE` from `prefer` to `force` on every ssh and scp launch (connect, tunnel, file browser, snippet). OpenSSH's `prefer` mode silently no-ops when both `DISPLAY` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` are empty and falls back to the TTY prompt, which broke Bitwarden, 1Password, Vault KV, pass and keychain lookups for users running purple inside a remote shell on Arch, Hyprland and other headless Linux setups
- Extract the SSH_ASKPASS env wiring into `askpass_env::configure_ssh_command` so all four call sites share one regression test that inspects `Command::get_envs()` directly. A future change back to `prefer` now fails CI
- Resolves #19

## 2.33.0

- Tmux-aware SSH: new window instead of TUI suspend
- When purple runs inside a tmux session, pressing Enter on a host opens SSH in a new tmux window named after the alias. The purple TUI stays alive in the original window so you can switch between sessions with `prefix + n/p` and keep navigating other hosts
- Detection via `$TMUX` env var. No tmux means the current suspend-and-restore behavior is unchanged
- Hosts with an askpass source (keychain, 1Password, Bitwarden, Vault KV, pass, cmd) keep the suspend-TUI flow because the askpass relay needs inherited stdin
- Vault SSH cert signing still runs before the tmux window opens, so short-lived certs are refreshed exactly as before. Signing status messages surface via the purple status bar
- Resolves #18

## 2.32.1

- Remove vault sign from host list footer to reduce clutter

## 2.32.0

- Structured logging to ~/.purple/purple.log
- `--verbose` flag enables debug-level logging. `PURPLE_LOG` env var for finer control (trace/debug/info/warn/error/off)
- `purple logs` subcommand: `--tail` to follow in real time, `--clear` to delete
- Log entries carry fault domain prefixes: `[external]` for remote/tool errors, `[config]` for local config issues, `[purple]` for internal errors
- Startup banner records purple version, SSH version, terminal, providers and askpass sources for diagnostics
- Automatic log rotation at 5 MB

## 2.31.0

- HashiCorp Vault SSH certificate signing
- Short-lived SSH certificates signed via the HashiCorp Vault SSH secrets engine. Per-host role in `# purple:vault-ssh <mount>/sign/<role>`, per-provider default in `vault_role=`. Host overrides win over provider defaults
- `V` key bulk-signs every host needing renewal. Press `V` again to cancel. Detail panel shows cert TTL under the `VAULT SSH` section with a "(press V to sign)" affordance when missing, expired or invalid
- Automatic renewal on connect via `ensure_vault_ssh_if_needed`, so an expired cert is re-signed before the SSH session starts
- Cert cache under `~/.purple/certs/<alias>-cert.pub`. Background status checks with 5 minute TTL, shorter 30 second backoff on errors
- Detail panel reflects external `purple vault sign` runs (CLI or another purple instance) within one render frame via mtime-based cache invalidation
- Vault SSH address configurable per host (`# purple:vault-addr`), per provider (`vault_addr=`) or per CLI invocation (`purple vault sign --vault-addr`). Purple exports the resolved value as `VAULT_ADDR` on the `vault` subprocess, so you no longer need to export it in every shell you launch purple from
- New "Vault SSH Role" and "Vault SSH Address" fields in the host and provider forms. Progressive disclosure: Address appears when Role is set, with provider inheritance hint
- CLI: `purple vault sign <alias>` and `purple vault sign --all`, both accepting `--vault-addr <url>`. Shells out to `vault write -field=signed_key` so existing Vault authentication (VAULT_TOKEN, token helpers, OIDC, etc.) applies
- Bulk sign detects concurrent external `~/.ssh/config` edits via mtime and merges instead of overwriting, so edits in another editor are preserved
- Virtual tags `vault-ssh` (any host with a resolved role) and `vault-kv` (any host using the `vault:` askpass prefix) for filtering
- Distinct from the HashiCorp Vault KV secrets engine used as a password source via the `vault:` askpass prefix. UI, CLI and docs keep the two engines strictly separated
- Vault SSH address normalization: bare IP or hostname auto-expands to `https://IP:8200`. Explicit `http://` for dev-mode Vault servers
- 30 second timeout on vault CLI subprocess. Previously hung indefinitely when the Vault server was unreachable
- Friendly error messages for common Vault SSH failures: connection refused, connection timed out, host not found, TLS mismatch (HTTP vs HTTPS), permission denied, token expired
- Signing progress shows animated spinner. Error messages stay visible until the next action (sticky status)
- Pre-check on `V`: warns immediately when no Vault address is configured instead of failing silently after the confirm dialog
- Detail panel Vault SSH section: shows role name instead of full mount path. Address moved to edit form (e) to save space
- 1000+ new tests covering the Vault SSH write paths, wildcard safety invariants (proptest across 512 random configs), Match block inertness, CRLF preservation, rollback on write failure, mtime cache staleness, subprocess env propagation and CLI flag parsing

- Custom themes from `~/.purple/themes/*.toml`
- CLI: `purple theme list`, `purple theme set <name>` and `--theme <name>` session override
- Pattern inheritance: ProxyJump, User and IdentityFile from pattern blocks (e.g. `Host *`, `Host web-*`) now inherited by matching hosts. ↗ indicator and ping logic reflect inherited ProxyJump
- Edit form shows inherited values as dimmed placeholders with source pattern (e.g. `gateway  ← *`)
- Self-referencing ProxyJump loop detection: ↗ in error color, ROUTE warning in detail panel and fix hint in edit form when a pattern assigns a host as its own jump host
- Fix detail panel PATTERN MATCH section no longer shows hostname-matched patterns that SSH would not apply
- Fix error messages now show in overlay footers instead of behind dimmed background
- Fix editing multi-host patterns (e.g. `Host web-* db-*`) failing with false "no longer exists" error
