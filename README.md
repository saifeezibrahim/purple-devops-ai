## Why I built this

My SSH config was fine. Proper aliases, ProxyJump chains, organized by provider. Not the problem.

The problem was everything around it. Need to check a container? `ssh host docker ps`. Copy a file? `scp` with the right flags. Run the same command on ten hosts? Write a loop or boot up Ansible for a one-liner. Spin up a VM on Hetzner? Open the console, grab the IP, edit config, save. Someone asks which box runs what? Good luck.

I wanted one place for all of that. So I built it.

## What you get

<img src="screenshots/detail.png" width="55%" align="left" alt="detail panel">

🔍 **Everything at a glance.** Connection info, jump route, activity sparkline, tags, tunnels, snippets, containers and server metadata. Health dots show which hosts are up. Group by provider, tag or flat.

<br clear="both">
<br>

⚡ **Instant fuzzy search.** Names, IPs, tags, users. Frecency sorting puts your most-used hosts on top. Works the same with 5 hosts or 500. Scoped search within groups.

![fuzzy search](screenshots/search.png)

☁️ **16 cloud providers.** AWS, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, GCP, Azure, Proxmox VE, Vultr, Linode, UpCloud, Scaleway, Tailscale, Oracle Cloud, OVHcloud, Leaseweb, i3D.net and TransIP. VMs appear, IPs update, stale hosts dim. Region, instance type, OS and status synced as metadata.

🐳 **Containers over SSH.** Docker and Podman. Start, stop, restart. No agent on the remote, no extra ports. Just SSH.

![containers](screenshots/containers.png)

**And more.** Visual file transfer with split-pane explorer. Multi-host command execution with snippets. Automatic password retrieval from OS Keychain, 1Password, Bitwarden, pass and the HashiCorp Vault KV secrets engine. Short-lived SSH certificates signed via the HashiCorp Vault SSH secrets engine. Command palette (`:`) for quick access to all actions. MCP server for AI agents like Claude Code and Cursor. See the [wiki](https://github.com/erickochen/purple/wiki) for details.

## How it works

purple reads `~/.ssh/config` directly. No database, no daemon, no account. Comments, indentation, Include files, unknown directives. All preserved.
